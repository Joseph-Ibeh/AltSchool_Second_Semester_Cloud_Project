# AltSchool Second Semester Examination Cloud Project - Joseph Ibeh


## Introduction

Welcome to my Cloud Engineering Second Semester Examination documentation. In this project, I successfully provisioned a Linux server, installed a web server (Apache), deployed a simple HTML landing page, and configured networking to allow HTTP traffic. The project showcases my journey in creating a web application prototype and highlights key skills in server management and web deployment.



## Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

1. Provision a Linux server using AWS.
2. Install and configure a web server (Apache) to serve web content.
3.Create a simple HTML landing page that includes "your name, a project title such as Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page, a brief description of your project, and your full bio with all the interesting information about you".
4. Configure networking to allow HTTP traffic (port 80) and optionally HTTPS traffic (port 443).
5. Provide a public IP address or domain name for external access to the web page.



## Tools and Technologies

- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Linux Distribution**: Ubuntu
- **Web Server**: Apache
- **SSH**: For server management and connection
- **HTML**: For creating web content
- **Certbot**: For managing SSL certificates (Optional for HTTPS configuration)



## Server Provisioning

### Objective:
To set up a Linux server using AWS for a web application prototype.

### Steps:

1. **Sign in to AWS**:
   - Visit [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
  
2. **Create a New Instance**:
   - Click on "EC2" in the AWS console.
   - Choose a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 ).
   - Configure instance settings, ensuring a public IP is assigned.

3. **Configure Key Pair**:
   - Create a new key pair (download the private key for future SSH access).

4. **Create Security Group**:
   - Allow HTTP & HTTPS traffic on port 80, 443 and SSH on port 22.

6. **Connect to the Server**:
   - Use SSH to connect to the server using the private key:
     ```bash  
     ssh -i [path_to_private_key] ubuntu@[public_ip_address]  
     ```
![Connect](https://github.com/Joseph-Ibeh/AltSchool_Second_Semester_Cloud_Project/blob/main/images/click-connect.png)

## Web Server Setup

### Objective:
To set up a web server to serve web content.

### Steps:

- **ssh to your gitbash CLI**

 ```bash  
     ssh -i [path_to_private_key] ubuntu@[public_ip_address]  
 ```

  ![ssh CLI](https://github.com/Joseph-Ibeh/AltSchool_Second_Semester_Cloud_Project/blob/main/images/terminal-ssh-in.png)

- **Switch to root user**

![root user](https://github.com/Joseph-Ibeh/AltSchool_Second_Semester_Cloud_Project/blob/main/images/switch-to-sudoer.png)
  
1. **Update and Install Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apache2 -y

   ```

2. **Start Apache Service**

  ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

![update,  install, start apache2](https://github.com/Joseph-Ibeh/AltSchool_Second_Semester_Cloud_Project/blob/main/images/sudo-apt-install-apache....png)

3. **Check Web Server:**

Open a web browser and visit the serverâ€™s public IP address to confirm Apache is working.


## HTML Page Deployment
Objective:
Create and deploy a simple HTML page on the server.

### Steps:
1. Create HTML File:

```bash
sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html
```


2. Add the HTML Content:

The content of HTML page
